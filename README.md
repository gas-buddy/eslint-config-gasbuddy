GasBuddy opinions about Javascript (ok, so it's airbnb minus some stuff). Mainly
here to provide an abstraction for all our projects that allows updated rules
to propagate more easily and under our control.

## V6.1.0

The main changes in this version are changes to the arrow-parens rule.  We also updated the underlying libraries including updating ESLint v5 -> v6.
