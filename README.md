# eslint-config-gasbuddy

GasBuddy opinions about Javascript and Typescript (ok, so it's airbnb
minus some stuff). Mainly here to provide an abstraction for all our
projects that allows updated rules to propagate more easily and under our control.

## V7.0.0

A completely new version based on Typescript.
